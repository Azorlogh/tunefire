# Tunefire

Tunefire is a modular tag-based music streaming app that connects to multiple streaming services.

### Organizing music with tags

Tunefire makes it easy to manage your music by allowing you to tag songs with custom attributes such as speed, joyfulness, intensity, or any other feature you choose.  
By filtering songs based on tags, you can create personalized playlists to suit your every mood and occasion.

### Multi-source

Tunefire's streaming client is plugin-based, making it simple to add new streaming services.  
Here is the current implementation status of each planned streaming service.

| service     | Streaming | Search |

| Soundcloud  | ✅         | ✅      |
| Youtube     | 🔃        | ❌      |

## Author's note

I am working on this project solely in my free time, therefore you can expect Tunefire's development progress to be quite sporadic. The primary goal is to create an app that I can use for my daily listening sessions, but it has yet to reach that point.
